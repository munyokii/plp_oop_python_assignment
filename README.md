# Object Oriented Programming Principles in Python

This repository contains examples and exercises demonstrating the four main principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

## Assignment 1

### Task 1: Smartphone Classes

1. Create a class `Smartphone` with attributes like brand, model, storage, and methods to power on/off and use battery.
2. Create a subclass `SmartphonePro` that adds a camera feature.

### Task 2: Vehicle Movement

1. Create classes for different vehicles (Car, Boat, Airplane, Train) with a method `move()` that describes their movement.
2. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `move()` method on each vehicle instance.
